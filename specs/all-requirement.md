### **Product Requirement Document: AI-Powered Stock Analyzer** 

**1. Introduction** 

This document outlines the product requirements for an AI-Powered Stock Analyzer. This system will provide users with in-depth stock analysis by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM) agents and a custom data processing backend. The platform is designed for users interested in detailed stock insights and will feature a secure authentication system, an administrative interface for managing LLM providers, and a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability. 

**2. User Roles and Stories** 

*   **User:** Can register for an account, log in, view stock analysis, and select different LLM agents for analysis. 
*   **Admin:** Has full access to the system, including user management, and the ability to add, configure, and monitor LLM providers. 

**3. System Architecture** 

The system will be comprised of three main components: a frontend application, a backend API, and an MCP server for data processing and analysis. 

*   **Frontend:** A responsive and intuitive user interface built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. 
*   **Backend:** A robust and scalable API developed with Rust and the Axum framework. It will handle user authentication, and requests to the MCP server, and manage LLM providers. 
*   **MCP Server:** A stdio-based (standard input/output) server built in Rust responsible for data-intensive tasks like fetching stock data, performing calculations, and interacting with the LLM agents. 

**4. Functional Requirements** 

**4.1 User Management** 

*   **User Registration:** Users can sign up with a username, email, and password. 
*   **User Login:** Registered users can log in to access the system. 
*   **Admin Role:** A designated admin role with elevated privileges. 

**4.2 Stock Analysis** 

*   **Stock Symbol Search:** Users can search for stocks by their ticker symbol. 
*   **LLM Agent Selection:** Users can choose from a variety of LLM agents for their analysis, such as: 
    *   Agent Warren E. Buffett 
    *   Agent Walter Schloss 
*   **Analysis Presentation:** The analysis results will be displayed in a clear and understandable format. 

**4.3 MCP Server** 

*   The server will communicate with the backend via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) over stdio. 
*   It will expose functions for: 
    *   Retrieving historical and real-time stock data. 
    *   Performing financial calculations. 
    *   Interfacing with the selected LLM agent to generate analysis. 

**4.4 LLM Provider Management (Admin Only)** 

*   **Provider Integration:** The admin can add and configure multiple LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic). 
*   **API Key Management:** Securely store and manage API keys for each provider. 
*   **Usage Tracking:** The system will record the usage of each LLM provider for monitoring and cost management purposes. 

**5. Non-Functional Requirements** 

*   **Security:** 
    *   Secure password hashing for user credentials. 
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities. 
    *   Secure handling of API keys. 
*   **Performance:** 
    *   The backend and MCP server should be highly concurrent and have low response times. 
    *   The frontend should be optimized for fast loading and a smooth user experience. 
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle a growing number of users and stock analysis requests. 
*   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain and extend. 

**6. Technology Stack** 

*   **Backend:** Rust, Axum, Tokio, Diesel (for database interactions)
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for user data and LLM provider configurations
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions 
*   **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript 
*   **MCP Server:** Rust, stdio MCP server with functions for stock data retrieval and LLM interaction
*   **LLM Providers:** OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic (and others as needed)
